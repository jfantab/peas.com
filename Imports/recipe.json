Beat in flour mixture, alternating with chocolate mixture in 2 additions. Divide batter among paper liners. Bake until tester inserted into center comes out with some crumbs attached, about 15-18 minutes. Cool in pans on cooling rack for 10 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to rack and cool completely.FROSTING: Beat butter until creamy. Add in the powdered sugar a cup at a time to avoid mess and add the melted chocolate and continue to mix until the sugar, butter, and chocolate are well combined. Add the chili powder, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and pinch of salt and mix until spices are mixed.

Line cupcake pans with liners (about 30). Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Combine water, oil, vinegar, instant coffee, and vanilla in a large mixing cup. Whisk to combine, then add to the dry ingredients and whisk just until the batter comes together. A few lumps are okay. Fill cupcake liners about 2/3 full and bake for about 12-15 minutes. (Mine baked in 14 minutes.) Cool completely before frosting. While the cupcakes are in the oven, make the frosting. (There is cooling time involved.) Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in sugar, cocoa, and salt. The mixture will be thick and grainy. Whisk heavy cream, sour cream, and instant coffee in a large measuring cup. Slowly add the cream mixture into your saucepan and whisk until smooth. Cook over medium-low heat until the sugar has dissolved and is hot to the touch, between 4-8 minutes. (Mine cooked in about 4 minutes, but it could take longer.) Do not boil! Transfer frosting to a bowl and let cool 2-3 hours until it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spreadable. You can also chill it so it will set up faster. If it gets to hard to spread, microwave it on 20 second intervals, stirring in between, until it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the desired consistency. Add cold heavy cream to an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Begin beating on high. (It helps if the bowl is also cold to start.) After a minute, add sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla to the cream. Continue beating for another 1-2 minutes, until heavy peaks form. Scrape the sides and fold in any undissolved cinnamon. Transfer filling to a pastry bag fitted with tip #230 for filling cupcakes. Poke the tip into the center of each cupcake and press bag to fill. Frost top of cupcake with chocolate frosting. Store in refrigerator, let come to room temperature before serving."},
